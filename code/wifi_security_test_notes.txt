Wi-Fi Security Assessment Notes (aircrack-ng)
==============================================
Author: Ayush  
Tool: aircrack-ng (Kali Linux)  
Scope: Personal/Authorized Wi-Fi Network Only  

1. Objective
------------
To evaluate the strength of my own Wi-Fi password using a legal, offline cracking method.  
This helps understand wireless security, detect weak configurations, and apply hardening.

2. Rules of Engagement (Legal & Ethical)
----------------------------------------
- Only my personal Wi-Fi network was tested.
- No unknown or unauthorized networks were targeted.
- Assessment was done strictly for learning & defensive security improvement.

3. Tools & Environment
----------------------
- OS: Kali Linux
- Wireless Adapter: Supports monitor mode + packet injection
- Toolset:
  - airmon-ng
  - airodump-ng
  - aireplay-ng
  - aircrack-ng

4. Complete Workflow + Commands
-------------------------------

STEP 1 — Enable Monitor Mode
----------------------------
# Identify wireless interface
ifconfig  
iwconfig

# Stop interface (optional)
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down

# Start monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# Monitor interface becomes:
wlan0mon

STEP 2 — Scan Wireless Networks (Only for identifying my own router)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

(Here I noted my own network’s BSSID, channel, and ESSID.  
No third-party network was captured or saved.)

STEP 3 — Capture Handshake of My Own Wi-Fi Network
---------------------------------------------------
sudo airodump-ng --bssid <MY_BSSID> --channel <CH> -w capture wlan0mon

Output generated:
capture.cap  
capture-01.cap  
capture-01.csv  
capture-01.kismet.csv  

STEP 4 — Optional: Deauthentication (ON MY OWN NETWORK ONLY)
--------------------------------------------------------------
This forces my own device to reconnect and generate a handshake.

sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a <MY_BSSID> wlan0mon

Handshake appears in top right of airodump-ng.

STEP 5 — Offline Password Testing
---------------------------------
Using a wordlist (rockyou.txt or custom list):

sudo aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt capture-01.cap

If cracked:
[KEY FOUND] -> <password>

If not cracked:
"Passphrase not in dictionary"

(No password is stored in this file.)

STEP 6 — Disable Monitor Mode & Restore Adapter
------------------------------------------------
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon  
sudo service NetworkManager restart

5. Findings (Fill Based on Your Results)
----------------------------------------
- Encryption: WPA2/WPA3  
- Handshake: Successful  
- Crack Result: Yes / No  
- Time Taken: Short / Medium / Long  
- Password Strength: Weak / Medium / Strong  

*No sensitive details (MAC/BSSID/password) are included.*

6. Security Risks Identified
----------------------------
- Weak or dictionary-based passwords are easily broken via offline attacks.  
- Short passwords (<10 characters) reduce security significantly.  
- Using names, DOB, phone numbers increases risk.

7. Hardening Actions Performed
------------------------------
After the test, I secured my Wi-Fi by:

- Setting a **14+ character strong password** (random, symbols, uppercase/lowercase).
- Verifying router uses **WPA2/WPA3** encryption.
- Disabling **WPS**.
- Separating IoT devices using Guest network (optional).
- Updating router firmware.

8. Key Learnings
----------------
- aircrack-ng demonstrates how attackers exploit weak wireless passwords.
- A strong passphrase is the simplest and most effective defense.
- Wireless security includes both technical settings and password hygiene.

9. Ethical Notice
-----------------
This workflow must **ONLY** be used on networks you own or have full permission for.  
Unauthorized Wi-Fi cracking is illegal.  
This file is for learning and defensive cybersecurity only.
